    <p class="text-white font-italic text-center" style="font-size: 18px">In January 2021, India saw an unemployment rate of over six percent. This was a significant improvement from the previous month. A damaging impact on an economy as large as Indiaâ€™s caused due a total lockdown was imminent. Unemployment went up to nearly 24 percent in April 2020. This was possibly a result of a decrease in demand as well as the disruption of workforce faced by companies. Furthermore, this caused a GVA loss of more than nine percent for the Indian economy that month.

We had deeply analyzed this and realized that there are a lot of skilled but unemployed people . Similarly there is another group consisting of large open source, service and product  based  MNCs which are in need of labor force .  But somehow there is this huge gap between these two sections and even if the Unemployed try to approach these huge companies the have to go through or contact through an agent .. these agents then sometimes take an advantage of the situation and ask for high commission rates . Here is when we come in we will be acting as mediators between the Unemployed and the MNCs, Registered MNCs would send their requirements to us along with few tasks respective to the job requirement. we would now give these tasks and deadline to the job seeking people and upon completion of which we would be paying them wages for each task and after a certain number of tasks we would ten forward their resume along with their task performances and other previous records to the MNCs for the next stage i.e. hiring.</p>
